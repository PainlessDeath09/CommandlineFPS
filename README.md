# CommandlineFPS
A First Person Shooter in command line
This is a small side project of mine being inspired from old breakthrough games such as Wolf3D and how it would look like if it were designed just a few years before its original release using pure ASCII characters. <br> Level design using pure ascii was hard not to mention perspective correction and updation of maps.<br> <br>
This program expects the console dimensions to be set to: <br>
	120 Columns by 40 Rows <br><br>
Font<br>
<t>"Consolas", size 16<br>
<t>Controls: A = Turn Left, D = Turn Right, W = Walk Forwards, S = Walk Backwards
