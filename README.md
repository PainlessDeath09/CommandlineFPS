# CommandlineFPS
A First Person Shooter in command line
This is a small side project of mine being inspired from old breakthrough games such as Wolf3D and how it would look like if it were designed just a few years before its original release using pure ASCII characters. Level design using pure ascii was hard not to mention perspective correction and updation of maps. 
This program expects the console dimensions to be set to:
	120 Columns by 40 Rows
Font:
  "Consolas", size 16
Controls: A = Turn Left, D = Turn Right, W = Walk Forwards, S = Walk Backwards
